# odin-recipes
A recipe website created while learning through The Odin Project.

In this project I will be practicing all my current knowledge of HTML to create a recipe website that 
will have a main index page and several links to different recipies. I will be demostrating the 
use of all the  main HTML components, including headings, bold and italic text, and both relative 
and absolute hyperlinks.
